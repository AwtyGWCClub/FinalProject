Senor Cactus game outline:

  Game starts:
    ->Background starts moving
    ->Senor Cactus avoids obstacles:
          -Jumps over barrels, oil
              Use jumping code to jump on/ over barrels and oils and intersection code to trigger a block when touching the barrels
          -Collects raindrops
              Use jumping code and intersection code to trigger the "gain a life" code
      If touches any of these things, use intersection code, and trigger the "Lose" animation (where image "normal" cactus changes to "dead" cactus while making him fall)
      If he suceeds, proceed to ending animation.
